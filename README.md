Slides from my talk Fantastic Problems and Where to Find Them, first given at Futurice London's Beer & Tech session on 20/4/2017. The talk is designed as a high level introduction to machine learning and the kinds of problems it's well suited to solve. It contains real-world examples from various industries, chosen to highlight sites and services that most people will be familiar with.

If you find the material here interesting and want to learn more about machine learning and related topics, there are a number of resources I find useful:
- for programmers who are beginners in the area and don't object to Python, [this Github repo](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning) is an amazing collection of tutorials, blog posts, and Jupyter notebooks.
- for programmers with a bit more experience, or who prefer to use a non-Python language, [this repo](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) has a list of ML resources by language and application area.
- if you're a designer and want some ideas about how to work with systems that use machine learning, [this blog post](https://medium.com/@girardin/experience-design-in-the-machine-learning-era-e16c87f4f2e2) is a great starting point.
- Lassi Liikkanen has written [another great article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/applications-machine-learning-designers/) about machine learning for designers, including some suggested design patterns for interfaces packed by machine learning algorithms.
- if you just want to read more about some of the history and popular uses of machine learning, [The Master Algorithm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0147SEZ92/) by Pedro Domingos is (afaik) the only popular science book on the topic. Luckily, it's a good read.
